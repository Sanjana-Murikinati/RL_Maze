# RL_Maze
A maze-based game to learn Reinforcement Learning (RL), where an AI agent navigates using rewards and penalties. Players explore Q-learning, policy optimization, and strategy improvement through interactive challenges. 🎮🤖
A fun maze-based game to learn **Reinforcement Learning (RL)!** 🎮🤖  

### **Game Concept:**  
- **"Agent in a Maze"** 🏁: Control an AI agent that learns to navigate a maze using RL.  
- **"Reward & Punishment System"** 🎯: The agent earns rewards for reaching the goal and penalties for hitting obstacles.  
- **"Q-Learning & Policy Updates"** 🔄: Visualize how the agent improves its strategy over time.  
- **"Explore vs. Exploit"** 🔍: Experiment with different exploration strategies (ε-greedy, softmax).  
- **"Train & Compete"** 🏆: Watch your agent evolve and compare performance with other players!  

📊 **Learn Q-learning, Deep Q-Networks (DQN), and policy optimization—all through gameplay!** 🚀
